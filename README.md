# Semantic-Web-Project

Here, we have used Protege 5.2.0 for creating ontologies (= grammar) and merged it and serialised it using file_name.owl

OWL is Ontology Web Language.

In IDE, provide dependency for Apache Jena library, springboot, maven. Data persistence in database is not used here hence database dependency is not needed.
